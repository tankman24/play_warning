circuit that plays a warning mpg message to a preamp output when the input voltage 12v goes high

I'm a retired programmer/analyst with higher level languages.  The code is not an issue.  I'm new to the circuitry. 

this device is to sound/play an mpg file when the input 12v voltage goes high. The input voltage is coming from upstream from another switch.
The mpg file is to go out at a preamp level to an audio mixing panel.

I am seeking recommendations at to the devices to use to accomplish this task.
Thanks, in advance!
